# Underwater Fishing Camera

## Introduction

As a shore angler, I've spent countless hours casting my line, waiting for bites that never came. The frustrating reality? I often had no idea if there were even any fish where I was casting. It didn't matter how good my lure was or how expensive my bait â€“ if the fish weren't there, I wasn't catching anything.

Unlike anglers with boats who can afford expensive sonar fishfinders, I needed a budget-friendly solution that would work from the shore. That's when the idea hit me: why not create a small underwater camera that I could attach to my fishing line? This way, I could scout locations before wasting time fishing in empty water.

## Why ESP32-CAM?

The ESP32-CAM module was the perfect choice for this project. Its compact size makes it ideal for attaching to a fishing line without adding too much weight or bulk that would interfere with casting. The module is also incredibly easy to program, with built-in WiFi capabilities that allow real-time video streaming directly to my phone.

Compared to other camera solutions, the ESP32-CAM offered the best balance of:
- **Size**: Small enough to attach to fishing gear
- **Cost**: Affordable for a DIY project
- **Functionality**: Built-in camera and WiFi in one module
- **Ease of use**: Well-documented and beginner-friendly

## Design Challenges & Solutions

Building this underwater camera presented three major challenges that required creative engineering solutions:

### Challenge 1: Power Supply

The ESP32-CAM requires a stable 5-volt power supply, but standard batteries don't provide this exact voltage. I needed a compact, affordable power solution that could fit inside a waterproof housing.

**Solution: Custom PCB with Voltage Regulation**

I taught myself KiCAD and designed a custom printed circuit board to solve this problem. The PCB design included:
- A socket for a standard 9V battery (the most cost-effective option)
- An integrated voltage converter to step down from 9V to the required 5V
- A soldered outlet to securely attach the 9V battery
- Direct connection to the ESP32-CAM module

This custom board became the backbone of the entire system, efficiently powering the camera while keeping costs low.

### Challenge 2: Waterproof Control Interface

Opening a watertight case every time I needed to power on the camera or start recording would be impractical and risk water damage. I needed external controls that maintained the waterproof seal.

**Solution: Waterproof Button and Water-Sensing Trigger**

I used a clear PVC pipe as the main housing, cut to the appropriate length with caps on both ends. For the control interface:

**Power Button:**
- Created a groove in one end cap for a button soldered directly to the PCB
- Applied a silicon coating over the button for waterproofing
- Applied a layer of rubber on top of the button 
- Added an outer cap that compressed the rubber and with an opening that allows the button to be pressed while maintaining the seal
- This allows powering the camera on/off without opening the case

**Automatic Recording Trigger:**
- Installed a steel pin that protrudes through the case (fully waterproofed)
- Connected the pin to the ESP32-CAM's input pins via the PCB
- When submerged, water conductivity creates a small current between the pin and ground
- The ESP32 detects this current and automatically starts recording
- This eliminates the need for manual recording activation once underwater

### Challenge 3: Battery Access and Replacement

While the main housing needed to remain sealed during use, I still needed a way to easily replace the 9V battery when it ran out, without compromising the waterproof integrity of the camera compartment.

**Solution: Screw-On Battery Compartment**

On the opposite end from the control button, I designed a removable battery compartment:
- Attached a tubular screw mechanism to the main PVC pipe
- Added a separate end cap that screws onto this mechanism
- Applied waterproof sealant to the threads for a watertight seal
- Inside this compartment, I installed the wiring and soldered the 9V battery socket
- The compartment can be unscrewed for battery replacement, then securely resealed

This design allows quick battery swaps without exposing the sensitive electronics in the main camera housing.

## Version 1: Proof of Concept

The first version wasn't pretty, but it worked. It was proof that the idea could be made. We had a waterproof underwater camera that could be attached to a fishing line, powered by an affordable battery system, and controlled without opening the case. While the aesthetics and refinement would come later, V1 successfully demonstrated that I could scout fishing spots from shore without expensive equipment.
