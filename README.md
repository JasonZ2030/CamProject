## About Us

From the outside, we're just a group of middle school kids, but from the inside, there is a burning passion for creation. Toys4us expresses this passion, with a business that we've been long since devoted to. We hope not only, to provide goods for the market, but also to help young kids, like us, build crucial memories of joy and happiness. We hope to spread the love and support that our parents have given us, with toys that are unique and straight from our hearts and minds. Toys4us operates from a simple, at-home, system, however, we and our products are nothing short of greatness.

## Our Team

### Jason
**CEO of Toys4Us**

Having a local Toys "R" Us close down, at the age of five, many of my childhood dreams were shattered. At the time, it was like bottomless pit swallowing me whole, until the last glint of sunlight, was gone. Now, looking back at that moment, I think about all the kids that have been pulled down with me. That's when a new driving force emerged. One that I have never felt before, stronger than ever. I decided it wasn't going to stay like that. With renewed determination, I came together with my friends and founded Toys4Us, a place where kids could buy toys whenever they pleased.
